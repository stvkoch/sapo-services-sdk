# SAPO Services SDK for XAML+CS Windows Store Apps #

The are some issues when interacting with a **SOAP** interface from **XAML+CS Windows Store applications**. For this reason you should read the [How to SAPO SOAP Services in Windows8 document](https://github.com/sapo/sapo-services-sdk/tree/master/Client-SDK/Code/Windows8/XAML%2BCSharp/SOAP). 

## Documentation ##
The services documentation is available in the [services catalog](https://store.services.sapo.pt/en/Catalog). You have additional documentation in the [documentation section](https://github.com/sapo/sapo-services-sdk/tree/master/Client-SDK/Documentation) of the **SDK**.
