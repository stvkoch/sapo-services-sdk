# SAPO Services SDK for HTML5+JS Windows Store Apps #

Although for some services exist both **SOAP** and **HTTP-JSON** interfaces, it's strongly recommended that for **HTML5+JS** applications you use the **HTTP-JSON** interface.

The simpler way of consuming a **SOAP** service in a **HTML5+JS** application is to create a **WinRT** component that wraps the service calls. But there are issues to this approach. You can read more about these issues in [this post](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/winappswithcsharp/thread/676f2908-48a7-413e-9340-caa22956363e).

## SDK code in NuGet packages ##

The **SDK** code to interact with the services is available in [NuGet packages](https://nuget.org/packages?q=sapo).

## Documentation ##
The services documentation is available in the [services catalog](https://store.services.sapo.pt/en/Catalog). You have additional documentation in the [documentation section](https://github.com/sapo/sapo-services-sdk/tree/master/Client-SDK/Documentation) of the **SDK**.
